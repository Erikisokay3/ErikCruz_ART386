  <p> This is my submission for Assignment 2.A! One of my all time favorite bands is Mom Jeans, they're a Midwestern Emo influenced band. The band members consist of Eric Butler, Bart Thompson, Austin Carango, and Sam Kless. I went to one of their concerts last year in November and it was my first ever "mosh" type of experience, it was really fun! and a bit crazy. I think they're extremely underrated, and need to get famous and rich now because they deserve it! Now!  </p>

  <p> One song from each of their albums that have stuck with me so far. I love the style of editing they went for in this music video, and the song from their, "best buds" album was the first song I ever listened to back in freshman year of college! The Album Puppy Love was full of fun songs so any song from that album was very sweet and cute.  </p>

  <p> This section is specifically to express my crush on Bart Thompson. He has his own band called "Graduating Life" and he seems like such a sweet guy, and he's cute, and I wish he was my boyfriend :^) He sings, writes, and produces his own music. It's crazy! When I went to see Mom Jeans live, I was able to get a picture with him right after the show too! His glasses were fogged up though!! lol. Also his leg tattoos are cool as heck. Slay king. </p>
